/*The type attribute is set to email for the email address field. This will enable client-side validation to ensure that the user enters a correctly formatted email address.

The type attribute is set to date for the booking date field. This will enable the browser's built-in date picker for the field.

The type attribute is set to number for the number of people field. This will use the browser's built-in number picker for the field.

The min attribute is added to the people input element to set the minimum value to 1.

The max attribute is added to the people input element to set the maximum value to 8.

The checkbox input element is contained inside the label element. For mobile devices, this will improve the user experience so that the user can touch either the checkbox or the text "I agree to the cancellation policy" to toggle the checkbox.

The checkbox input element has a required attribute. This will require that the user agrees to the cancellation policy before being able to book a table. /*
